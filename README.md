# Ember-d3-charts

This addon provides EmberJS components for charting data with d3.js.

See it in action: http://bryanhunt.github.io/#/d3charts

This project is very much in the experimental phase and the API is in flux.  
Use with caution.

Things that seem to be working:
* Line Charts
* Bar Charts
* Area Charts
* Bubble Charts
* Pie Charts
* Stacked Area Charts

If you have questions, you can generally find me on Slack in the EmberJS Community.

This is a fairly significant undertaking and I would welcome additional contributors.
