# Ember-d3-charts

This addon provides EmberJS components for charting data with d3.js.

This README outlines the details of collaborating on this Ember addon.

See it in action: http://bryanhunt.github.io/#/d3

This project is very much in the experimental phase and the API is in flux.  
Use with caution.

Things that seem to be working:
* XY Line Charts

This is a fairly significant undertaking and I would welcome additional contributors.
